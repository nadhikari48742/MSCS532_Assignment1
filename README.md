This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Insertion Sort** algorithm modified to sort an array into **monotonically decreasing order** (descending).

## Files
- insertion_sort_desc.py — Core insertion sort implementation (descending).
- main.py — Simple program to run the sort on a default list or user input.
- test_insertion_sort.py — Basic tests using Python assert statements.
- requirements.txt — No external dependencies are requried for this program.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ can be used to run this program because it is the latest. 

## How to Run

### we can run the demo program by executing the following line which runs the main.py file or run other files included directly.
python main.py
